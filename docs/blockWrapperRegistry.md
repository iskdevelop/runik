# Block Wrapper Registry
The `BlockWrapperRegistry<TBlockRegistry>` is a comprehensive and extensible registry that augments block types with metadata, logic, rendering options, and plugin systems. It wraps each block type with additional behavior and control structures, making it ideal for building sophisticated editor architectures that go far beyond just rendering content.
## Definition

```ts
import { BlockTypeRegistry } from "./blockTypeRegistry";

export type BlockWrapperRegistry<TBlockRegistry extends Record<string, any> = BlockTypeRegistry> = {
  [K in keyof TBlockRegistry]: {
    validate?: (data: TBlockRegistry[K]) => boolean;
    transform?: (data: TBlockRegistry[K]) => TBlockRegistry[K];
    rendering?: {
      element?: string;
      className?: string;
      attributes?: Record<string, any>;
      style?: Record<string, any>;
      parent?: {
        element?: string;
        attributes?: Record<string, any>;
        style?: Record<string, any>;
      };
      [key: string]: any;
    };
    plugins?: Array<any>;
    metadata?: Record<string, any>;
    hooks?: Record<string, (...args: any[]) => any>;
    [key: string]: any;
  };
};
```

`BlockWrapperRegistry` is a generic type used to enrich block definitions with behavior and configuration. It wraps each block type with a structured object that supports validation, transformation, rendering instructions, plugin integration, lifecycle hooks, and any custom extensions.

It is parameterized by a `TBlockRegistry`, which is a mapping of block names to their data structure. If not provided, it defaults to `BlockTypeRegistry`.

### 🔍 Section Breakdown

#### `validate?: (data: TBlockRegistry[K]) => boolean`

Optional function to validate the structure or correctness of a block's data. Useful for runtime safety, preventing malformed blocks from rendering or being saved.

---

#### `transform?: (data: TBlockRegistry[K]) => TBlockRegistry[K]`

An optional function to pre-process or modify the block's data before use. This can be used to sanitize, migrate, or normalize the content.

---

#### `rendering?: { ... }`

An optional object that defines how the block should be rendered. This includes:

* `element`: The HTML tag or component used for rendering.
* `className`: CSS class name to apply.
* `attributes`: HTML attributes to apply on the element.
* `style`: Inline styles.
* `parent`: An optional parent element with its own attributes and styles, allowing nested wrappers.
* `[key: string]: any`: Allows for additional rendering properties like `data-*` attributes or custom layout settings.

---

#### `plugins?: Array<any>`

An optional array of plugin functions, objects, or descriptors. These plugins can augment the block with extra capabilities like spellchecking, autosave, collaborative features, or analytics.

---

#### `metadata?: Record<string, any>`

Custom metadata for organizational, UI, or functional use. Could include fields like category, version, description, etc. It’s flexible and useful for tooling or visual editors.

---

#### `hooks?: Record<string, (...args: any[]) => any>`

A dictionary of lifecycle or event hooks for the block. Hooks might include `onCreate`, `onUpdate`, `onFocus`, `onDestroy`, etc. Enables reactive behavior in the editor.

---

#### `[key: string]: any`

A catch-all to allow extensibility. You can attach any additional custom configuration specific to your system, such as accessibility descriptors, feature toggles, analytics configs, or AI metadata.
